# Battery-Data-Analysis-and-Degradation-Modeling
This study presents an in-depth analysis of battery performance data to understand the degradation behavior over operational cycles. Using datasets containing detailed battery test measurements such as voltage, current, capacity, and temperature, the data is first cleaned and combined to form a comprehensive dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to investigate key variables and their relationships during charging and discharging phases. Charging and discharging capacities are computed cycle-wise, and the influence of varying C-rates on battery performance is examined. Polynomial regression models are employed to extrapolate charge capacity degradation trends with respect to cycle count across different C-rates. Additionally, the State of Health (SoH) is calculated and visualized to provide insights into the battery's aging process. The methodology and findings offer valuable insights for improving battery management and predicting lifespan in energy storage systems.
